# Project Background:

With everyone staying home, people are in need of entertainment that engages their minds and relieves stress accrued during their daily lives.  Our project will consist of a 2D platformer puzzle game that challenges players in a variety of different environments.  The core of the game is to challenge a single human player by making them solve puzzles using 2 in-game characters, and a system where teleportation is key to progressing.  Any player input causes a change to both characters which separates our game from other games of similar design and genre.

# Vision Statement

The target market is for puzzle and platformer game fans that are looking for a nostalgic and enriching experience. The product is a puzzle-platformer video game: “Astral Teleportation”. This game focuses on using portals to solve games in a 2D environment, while controlling two separate in-game characters simultaneously. That leads to a game that allows the player to relax and feel accomplished while progressing through the game. Unlike “Portal” or “The Company of Myself” it combines both types of games to create a new and interesting game. Our product offers platforming, critical thinking, unique gameplay, and story to play through to escape from everyday life.
