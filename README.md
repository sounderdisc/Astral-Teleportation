# Project Charter: 2 Character Simultaneous Control 2D Portal Platformer

# Project Background:

With everyone staying home, people are in need of entertainment that engages their minds and relieves stress accrued during their daily lives.  Our project will consist of a 2D platformer puzzle game that challenges players in a variety of different environments.  The core of the game is to challenge a single human player by making them solve puzzles using 2 in-game characters, and a system where teleportation is key to progressing.  Any player input causes a change to both characters which separates our game from other games of similar design and genre.

# Vision Statement

The target market is for puzzle and platformer game fans that are looking for a nostalgic and enriching experience. The product is a puzzle-platformer video game: “Astral Teleportation”. This game focuses on using portals to solve games in a 2D environment, while controlling two separate in-game characters simultaneously. That leads to a game that allows the player to relax and feel accomplished while progressing through the game. Unlike “Portal” or “The Company of Myself” it combines both types of games to create a new and interesting game. Our product offers platforming, critical thinking, unique gameplay, and story to play through to escape from everyday life.

# Constraints

- Some teammates do not have a powerful enough computer to run Unreal Engine or Unity.  This may prohibit them from working on certain tasks.
- Some teammates are not well versed in game creation software.  Thus, they will have to quickly learn about the selected engine and its programming language during the Sprints.
- Introducing two mechanics simultaneously.
- As a team of primarily computer scientists, we may need to stretch the art skills we have to complete the visual aspects of the game

# Assumptions

- Level creation will be unique and interesting as a result of using several different mechanics from other games. 

# Risks and Dependencies

- We must be able to use our creativity to make enough satisfying levels to flesh out a complete game.
- Forming creativity to figure out how to exactly create obstacles or ideas in each level.
- All team members must both have and understand the basics of the Unity environment.
