# Plot Workspace

Creating a story for Astral Teleportation is not a one man job. This file serves as a browser viewable workspace for all team members to document ideas for the plot of the game. This document should help give everyone inital ideas on what everyone else is thinking so that real time meetings can be more productive with respect to story discussion.

## Who are our two characters? Possible answers: 
- Two opposite colors that relate to the colors of their portals
- Two agents deployed to investigate a time-space anomaly that results in their movement being linked together
- Siblings pulled into the inciting incident
- Strangers pulled into the inciting incident

## Why must our two characters move in sync?
- Their portal gun techology requires it
- The time-space anomaly linked them together
- If we don't want to do dialog, this could intentionally never be explained as an astectic choice. ex: spirited away never explained why there was a spirit world, there just was
- maybe they're astral spirits dancing together

## Why can our characters use portals?
- The portal guns are part of their standard issue for a red/blue time space anomoly investigation officer
- They found a portal gun left by a techologically superior civilization across space and time in the astral dimention
- all dancing spirits can throw out portals on the eve of the dancing ceremony

## possible modes of story delivery
- ~~in between level cutscenes~~
- ~~There could be no dialog at all, and the backdrop of the levels could explain the story with a final cutscene at the end showing the resolution~~
- in level character portraits pop up and deliver text dialog to each other like in [fire emblem](https://youtu.be/A4TqmeHOCV0?t=281) games (CHOSEN)
- viewable text or voice artifacts are unlocked when the player collects optional collectables in the levels. These text or voice artifacts help tell the story. See [Halo 3: ODST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MglVqquKjnU&ab_channel=HaloCanon) for an example
