# Plot Workspace

Creating a story for Astral Teleportation is not a one man job. This file serves as a browser viewable workspace for all team members to document ideas for the plot of the game. This document should help give everyone inital ideas on what everyone else is thinking so that real time meetings can be more productive with respect to story discussion.

## Who are our two characters? Possible answers: 
- Two opposite colors that relate to the colors of their portals
- Two agents deployed to investigate a time-space anomaly that results in their movement being linked together
- Siblings pulled into the inciting incident
- Strangers pulled into the inciting incident

## Why must our two characters move in sync?
- Their portal gun techology requires it
- The time-space anomaly linked them together
- If we don't want to do dialog, this could intentionally never be explained as an astectic choice. ex: spirited away never explained why there was a spirit world, there just was
- maybe they're astral spirits dancing together

## possible modes of story delivery
- in between level cutscenes
- in level character portraits pop up and deliver text dialog to each other like in fire emblem games
- There could be no dialog at all, and the backdrop of the levels could explain the story with a final cutscene at the end showing the resolution
